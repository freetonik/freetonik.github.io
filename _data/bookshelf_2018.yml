  author: Cal Newport
  isbn: 9780349420219
  comment: "A nicely written case against the 'follow your passion' advice with a well-defined career-building strategy. As many non-fiction sel-help books, could be at least 10 times shorter, but hey, it's pretty good."

- title: "The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys"
  author: James Fadiman
  isbn: 9781594774027
  comment: This is a fascinating topic, and there's a lot of BS floating around it. This book is one of the good ones.
